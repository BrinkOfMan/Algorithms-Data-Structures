Compare the cycles per instruction, repeated as necessary, to the actual timed number of cycles.

- I believe there are 27 cycles outside of loop.png's main loop, and 9 cycles within each loop.

-- This gives a total of 100 loops * 9 cycles per loop + 27 cycles outside of the loop for 927 Total cycles.

--- This is a ~16% difference

- For recursion, I believe there are 30 cycles outside of the recursive function, and 15.333 inside the recursive function.

-- So, the total will be 100 recursion calls * 15.333 cycles per call + 30 cycles = 1,563

--- This is a ~26% difference
